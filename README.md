# Pypysonar
Pypysonar is a simple semantic indexer library for Python. After referencing PySonar2 (https://github.com/yinwang0/pysonar2) which uses java to create a advanced semantic indexer for python,
we created a python based semantic indexer for python.

# Functionality
Pypysonar can take simple python code and create a namespace hierarchy for the file. Currently supporting indexing classes, functions, and simple operations.
