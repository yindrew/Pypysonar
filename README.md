# Pypysonar
Pypysonar is a simple semantic indexer library for Python. After referencing PySonar2 (https://github.com/yinwang0/pysonar2) which uses java to create a advanced semantic indexer for python,
we created a python based semantic indexer for python.

# Functionality
Pypysonar can take simple python code and create a namespace hierarchy for the file. Currently supporting indexing classes, functions, and simple operations.

# Screenshots of demo

this is what the namespace hierarchy would look like with the numbers representing the starting line number and column number and the ending line number and column number.
